# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### <span style="font-size:14px;">`npm start`</span>

<span style="font-size:14px;">Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.</span>

<span style="font-size:14px;">The page will reload when you make changes.<br>
You may also see any lint errors in the console.</span>

### <span style="font-size:14px;">`npm test`</span>

<span style="font-size:14px;">Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.</span>

### <span style="font-size:14px;">`npm run build`</span>

<span style="font-size:14px;">Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.</span>

<span style="font-size:14px;">The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!</span>

<span style="font-size:14px;">See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.</span>

### <span style="font-size:14px;">`npm run eject`</span>

<span style="font-size:14px;">**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**</span>

<span style="font-size:14px;">If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.</span>

<span style="font-size:14px;">Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.</span>

<span style="font-size:14px;">You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.</span>
